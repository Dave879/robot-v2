# Dataset Capture Script - By: denisk - dom gen 1 2023

# Use this script to control how your OpenMV Cam captures images for your dataset.
# You should apply the same image pre-processing steps you expect to run on images
# that you will feed to your model during run-time.

import sensor, image, time

sensor.reset()                      # Reset and initialize the sensor.
sensor.set_pixformat(sensor.GRAYSCALE) # Set pixel format to RGB565 (or GRAYSCALE)
sensor.set_framesize(sensor.B64X64)   # Set frame size to QVGA (320x240)
time.sleep(0.01)

clock = time.clock()

while(True):
    clock.tick()
    img = sensor.snapshot()
    # Apply lens correction if you need it.
    # img.lens_corr()
    # Apply rotation correction if you need it.
    # img.rotation_corr()
    # Apply other filters...
    # E.g. mean/median/mode/midpoint/etc.
    print(clock.fps())
