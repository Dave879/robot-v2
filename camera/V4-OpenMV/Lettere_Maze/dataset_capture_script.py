# Dataset Capture Script - By: denisk - dom gen 1 2023

# Use this script to control how your OpenMV Cam captures images for your dataset.
# You should apply the same image pre-processing steps you expect to run on images
# that you will feed to your model during run-time.

import sensor, image, time

sensor.reset()                      # Reset and initialize the sensor.
sensor.set_pixformat(sensor.GRAYSCALE) # Set pixel format to RGB565 (or GRAYSCALE)
sensor.set_framesize(sensor.B64X64)   # Set frame size to QVGA (320x240)
sensor.skip_frames(time = 2000)     # Wait for settings take effect.
time.sleep(0.01)
sensor.set_auto_gain(True) # must be turned off for color tracking
sensor.set_auto_whitebal(True) # must be turned off for color tracking

    # Apply lens correction if you need it.
    # img.lens_corr()
    # Apply rotation correction if you need it.
    # img.rotation_corr()
